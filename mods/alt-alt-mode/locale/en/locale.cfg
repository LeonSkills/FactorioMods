alt-alt-radius=WARNING, setting this too high might cause performance issues. Set to 0 to only show selected entity.\n__CONTROL__alt-alt-increase-radius__ to increase and  __CONTROL__alt-alt-decrease-radius__ to decrease.
alt-alt-radius-indicator=Turn the radius indicator around the cursor on or off.
alt-alt-update-interval=Time in ticks between each update. Every update all icons are refreshed, and the cursor position is updated. Larger intervals means better performance for a less smooth experience.
alt-alt-turn-off-completely=If false, pressing alt toggles between off, alternative alt-mode and regular mode.\nIf true, only toggles between off and alternative alt-mode.
alt-alt-show-quality-badge=Display the quality icon at the bottom left of items, recipes and signals
alt-alt-show-quality-background=Colour the background of items, recipes and signals the colour of the quality. Otherwise, black.
alt-alt-blacklist=List of entity types not to draw information on, comma separated. You can find the type of an entity in the prototype explorer by pressing __CONTROL__open-prototypes-gui__ or by hovering over the entity and pressing __CONTROL__open-prototype-explorer-gui__. \nThere is currently (Factorio 2.0.28) a bug where the sprite does not follow robots properly, so this is off by default. See FFF-421 and forum topic 125393.\n'simple-entity' refers to rocks and ruins in the base game.
